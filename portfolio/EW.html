<p class="EW_text3"> the program here is a "create-a-account" system, it goes through the prompts of name username password and confirmation of password once the details have been filled out it makes a text file of the details once the account has been created. (note this is a program just to be simple not to be too overcomplicated and it was also done in spare time as a time waster and just simply making it as basic as possible with this personal project)</p>

	<p class ="EW_text3">The following program is a log-in system, a follow-up from the previous project. It uses the .txt file from the previous program as a checker if the password is correct or incorrect, it would go through the prompts simmilar to the first program and once its filled out it would write it on another .txt file. if th;e password written on those prompts matches with the file that is prepared it would recognise it is correct and display the message " Access Granted". However if it does not match it would provide the message " Access Denied". I have provided a video running the program demonstrating that the message shows when it matches and vice versa when it does not match. </p>

<p class ="EW_text3"> the following C# program is a ordering system as a canteen ordering system using a criteria of following features for the order to demonstrate as a assigment (this was apart of work for the certificate I was working towards, this was used in Winforms visual studio)   </p>

<p class="EW_text3"> the next C# program was a pet project to demonstrate primary saving indexes with-in the program the following theme i went with was games as it was the first theme my mind went to as it would save the name of the game, the console of the game, and it would know if it was a hard-copy or a digital copy(this was also part of my studies, and was used with Winforms on Visual Studio) </p>
